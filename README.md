This is my first portfolio submitted to 'The Learing People' as my first code project using HTML and CSS. 

The website will be attached to my CV for potential employers. 

The websie is designed to be minimal offering all of the relevant information in a straight forward fashion without clutter. 

The skills and projects currently take up more space than they need but will be adjusted when more skills and projects are added to the site. 

The contact form function is powered by currently Formspree.io and fully operational.
